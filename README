This is a little script I did because I have always wanted to type

:sp a.cpp b.hpp *.tex......

So... This does it now!

You just have to put this file in the plugin directory and the help in the doc directory and that will remap sp and vsp abbreviation to my function, allowing you to type :vsp *.txt

Let me know if you find some bugs ;-)
